Git-Optimized WordPress
=======================

This repository contains a version-control-optimized boilerplate structure for use in WordPress projects.

*Note: While this project uses Git for version control, the structure itself is software-agnostic. With a few minor modifications it could be used with any version control software, such as [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/).*

##### What's different?
 * WordPress is installed in its own subdirectory (`cms/`).
 * The active `wp-content/` subdirectory is located at the project root. 
 * The `wp-config.php` file is designed for inclusion in the project repository. It now contains only general project data and not sensitive, environment-specific data, such as database credentials or salts & keys.
 * This sensitive information is now contained in a localized config file that, for added security, has the option of being placed outside of the web root.
 * There is a template for the localized config file (`sample-config.php`).
 * There is a preconfigured `.gitignore` file.
 * Composer is used to install WordPress and any theme or plugin dependencies. There is a pre-configured `composer.json` file.

Setting up a new project repository
-----------------------------------

 1. Navigate into the project directory.
 2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/quayzar/git-optimized-wordpress.git .`
 3. Delete the `.git` directory to separate your files from this repository: `rm -rf .git`
 4. Update `wp-config.php` with default [salts & keys](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/).
 5. Create a new, project-specific repository:
```
git init
git add .
git commit -m 'initial commit'
```
 6\. [Push your local repository to GitHub](http://quayzar.com/git/pushing-a-local-repository-to-github/).
 
Installation
------------

Once your project repository has been set up, there are two remaining tasks: create a localized config file and install WordPress.

##### Creating a localized config file
 1. Create an empty database. Note the host, database name, username, and password, as you'll need them shortly.
 2. Copy `sample-config.php` to create a localized config file, replacing "sample" in the new name with "local", "dev", "staging", or "live", depending on the environment. Save it either at the web root (on the same level as `wp-config.php`) or, for enhanced security, one level up. [Read more here.](http://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/58391/is-moving-wp-config-outside-the-web-root-really-beneficial/74972#74972)
 3. Open this new file and make the following changes:
  * Provide `ADDL_SUBDIR` (if any).
  * Enter the database credentials.
  * [Generate](https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/) and add environment-specific salts & keys.
  * Configure the debug settings.
  * Remove the `die` warning at the bottom.

Running `git status` at this point should return neither modifications nor untracked files.

##### Installing & configuring WordPress
This project uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) both to install WordPress (hat-tip to [John P. Bloch](https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress)) and to manage any theme or plugin dependencies. If you don't already have Composer, [install it locally](https://getcomposer.org/download/).

Note: These instructions assume a global installation of Composer. If Composer is installed locally, replace `composer` in all the commands with `php composer.phar`.

Unless you've only just installed Composer, it's a good idea to run `composer self-update` before getting started.

 1. Create a blank `.htaccess` file and set permissions: `touch .htaccess && chmod 0644 .htaccess`
 2. Open `composer.json`, add any plugin or theme dependencies at the bottom of the `"require"` section, and save. There is both a plugin ([Akismet](https://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/)) and a theme ([Twenty Sixteen](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/)) already in this section for reference. If you edit the dependencies, add the changes to the repository: `git add composer.json`
 3. Run Composer to install WordPress and all dependencies: `composer install`
 4. Add the Composer-generated lock file to the repository: `git add composer.lock`
 5. If you have any theme dependencies (such as a parent theme) that shouldn't be in the repository, adjust `.gitignore` to reflect, then add the changes to the repository: `git add .gitignore`
 6. Run `git status` to confirm all modified or untracked files have been either added or ignored, then commit the changes.
 7. Load the project URL in a browser window. Complete the WordPress installation form and submit.
 8. Log into the WordPress backend.
 9. Select `Settings > Permalinks`, then update the Permalink structures and save. If you don't receive the "Permalinks structure updated" success message, adjust write permissions on `.htaccess` and try again.
 10. Remove `README.md` (recommended) and `LICENSE` (optional).

You now have a working Git-optimized installation of WordPress. Proceed with in-WordPress configuration: Activate plugins, import data, customize theme, etc.

Deployment
----------

Before deployment, review `composer.json` to confirm it reflects the current dependency set. Do not run `composer update` unless you are prepared to perform compatibility testing prior to deployment. If you do modify `composer.json`, commit those changes to your repository on GitHub:
```
git add composer.json
git commit -m 'update composer.json to reflect current dependencies'
git push
```

 1. SSH to the target host and navigate to the web root.
 2. Clone your repository.
 3. Follow the instructions listed under [Creating a localized config file](#creating-a-localized-config-file) above.
 4. [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) (if not already installed).
 5. Create a blank `.htaccess` file and set permissions: `touch .htaccess && chmod 0644 .htaccess`
 6. Run Composer to install WordPress and all dependencies: `composer install`
 7. Load the project URL in a browser window. Complete the WordPress installation form and submit. 
 8. Log into the WordPress backend.
 9. Click `Settings > Permalinks`, then update the Permalink structures and save. If you don't receive the "Permalinks structure updated" success message, adjust write permissions on `.htaccess` and try again.
 10. Perform in-WordPress configuration.
